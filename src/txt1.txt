Researchers and specialists in the field of environmental health explore many different aspects of human health and natural and human-made environments. Areas of focus range from food safety and the safety of drinking water to the control of air andlated to securing environmental and human health. Environmental health crosses boundaries with other fields in the area of public health, including epidemiology and toxicology.

Environmental pollution, which can result in the contamination o thereby cause disease in people who have been exposed, is a major area of concern in environmental health. Synthetic chemicals in the environment can enter the human body through inhalation or ingestion and can have chronic affects on the individual exposed to them. Certain chemical and physical environmental pollutants may also have hereditary consequences, causing infertility in the exposed individual or in his or her progeny. Environmental ionizing radiation is an example of a type of environmental pollutant that can affect the health of oneâ€™s offspring because of its ability to induce genetic mutations in germ cells (i.e., sperm and egg).
